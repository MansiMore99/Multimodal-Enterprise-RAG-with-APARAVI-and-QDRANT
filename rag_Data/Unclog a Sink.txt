How to Unclog a Sink, Tub, or Shower Drain With a Plunger
1. 
Use a standard bell-shaped plunger for clearing sink, tub, or shower clogs. Wear waterproof gloves and safety glasses.

Wet a Washcloth
Wet a washcloth thoroughly and set it aside for now.

Remove Drain Stopper or Cover
Remove the pop-up drain stopper from the sink basin or bathtub. For showers, remove the drain grate.

Add Water as Needed
Add water with a cup or bucket If the sink basin, tub, or shower pan does not already have enough water in it to cover the plunger’s cup.

Cover Overflow Hole, If Necessary
Fold the wet washcloth into a square and cover the sink or tub’s overflow hole with it (showers do not have this). It helps to have an assistant hold the washcloth so that you’ll have both hands available to work the plunger.
